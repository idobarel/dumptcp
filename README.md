## Syntax
the _-h_ argument should give you all the options in the app. but I would like to put it here as well;

### Args:
iface -> required | possitinal arg, no flag. | Takes the network adapter you want to use. <br>
output -> not required | -o OR --output flag | defualt = None. | Specify with file name if you want to write the captured packets to a .pcap file<br>
ip -> not required | -i OR --ip flag | defualt = "". | An IP filter, only capture traffic that related to the specified IP address (sender OR reciver)<br>
mac -> not required | -m OR --mac flag | defualt = "". | A MAC filter, only capture traffic that related to the specified MAC address (sender OR reciver)<br>

### Command syntax:
dumptcp [ IFACE ] [ ARGS... ]

### Examples:
```bash
$ dumptcp eth0 -o out.pcap 
```
will capture all the packets, and write to a pcap file.
```bash
